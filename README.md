# RL Infrastructure

This is a repo containing infra code for our ongoing RL side project.  The purpose of this repo is
to provide an API of RL functions for easy high level scripting, as well as encapsulate logic for
controling a GoPiGo robot.  The API should support three main use-cases: OpenAI gym environments,
custom-written games, and GoPiGo applications.

## API design

* [High level design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VL5hJyJd5oB35kslIKt86PKAYXl5PPbq9rP9wYnirfo/edit?usp=sharing) (very rough)

## Offline dataprep and training design

**TODO**
